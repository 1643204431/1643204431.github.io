Hi! I’m Yinghao Zhang, an incoming MPhil student at [Hong Kong Metropolitan University (HKMU)](https://www.hkmu.edu.hk/) supervised by [Dr. Yalin Liu](https://yalin-liu.github.io/), starting in January 2026.  
My research interests focus on federated learning, edge–cloud intelligence, and multi-modal AI for healthcare and materials science.

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at [BNBU](https://uic.edu.cn/en) with [Dr. Jianxiong Guo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lljLdDcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), focusing on efficient and personalized federated learning.  
Before that, I was a research visiting student in industry at [Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/) supervised by [Dr. Wei Dawid Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=FQUv9tkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
