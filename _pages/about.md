👋 Hi! I’m **Yinghao Zhang (张映豪)**. I will start my **MPhil** at **Hong Kong Metropolitan University (HKMU)** in **January 2026**. Currently, I’m a **Research Assistant** (Dec 2023–present), working with **Dr. Jianxiong Guo** on federated and multi-modal learning for medical and IoT applications. Before that, I was a research visiting student in industry at Hanyang University supervised by **Wei David Wang**.

My research focuses on:
- **Federated & Split Learning** (efficiency, personalization, one-shot FL, non-IID mitigation)
- **Edge–Cloud Collaboration** (communication–computation co-design, scheduling & distillation)
- **Multi-Modal Perception & Medical AI** (sEMG/ACC, imaging & signals, compressive sensing)
- (Broader interests) **Graph/Sequence Modeling**, **Compression & Efficient Training**
